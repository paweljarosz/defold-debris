# Defold Debris

This project was created for the [Defold Community Challenge #2: Explosions](https://forum.defold.com/t/community-challenge-explosions/77315)!

Play it online on Itch: [https://paweljarosz.itch.io/defold-debris](https://paweljarosz.itch.io/defold-debris)

It's an example on how to utilise Defold built-in components to create:
 - explostion particlefx out of a single image
 - utilise combination of collision object, sprite and script to create debris-like object
 - factory to spawn multiple debris objects at once

Functionality of debris instantiation is separated into `debris.lua` module.
You can import it to any of your game and use it!

Happy Defolding!
